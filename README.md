## Instructions

Use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/15/view) for self-checking your submission.

Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like `Player` and `Enemy`) or class prototype functions such as `Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions`. Also make sure that the keyword `this` is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon.

Your **README.md** file should be updated with instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

This are some sites that  *actually* help me get through this project.

### How the Game Work
You will have a player and Enemy. The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies.

 The following are some goals that you have to achieve in order to make this project interactive:

| Strategies | Description. |
| ------ | ------ |
| Player(Move)| The player should be able move left,right, up ,down |
| Enemy speed| you can use math.random methods |
| collide | Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the starting square|
|Winner | Once the player reaches the water (i.e., the top of the game board), the game is won |






### Development

Object oriented programming is new learning experience. I got little confident after finishing memorygame. But asusual when you get stuck , you will have second thought. But i was determined to finish this project.

The following are some steps for this project.  Hope it might help you.

```sh
1. "Where should i start!!!" Its okay to have that thought.
2.My initial thought was, i want to see player or enemies pop up. Also,I can see the enemy variable. Should I create enemy and player at once? 
3. Start focusing one of the game entities at the time. afterthat ,try commenting out any code in engine.js that refers to player at first. you will be able to see screen. (now i am in process of creating Enemy class and I realized they are just moving in one direction.)
4. ERROR :Enemies not define. This actually hunt me at the beginning. All you have to do was make empty array allEnemies= [];
5. Stars length depends on your moves. It will reduce if you click more cards.
5. Timer should be start once you click first card and stop after the last click.
6. Pop-up card should display once you matched all the cards.
```

For Outcome

```sh
If any confusion, "Console.log" helps you understand overall picture of your code.

```
